Zombies constantly change path to the tower. 
You move the tower with arrow keys and can shoot bullets to kill zombies
Every so often with a zombie dies it will drop a chest
If you collect a chest the bullets turn into lazers that can kill zombies instantly:

You die when a zombie touches you and brings you to the death screen:
